Responsive card using CSS flexbox. In this exercise I pratice CSS selectors, variable color in CSS, how to position card in the center with transform: translate, how to use hover pseudoclass and learned how to change list style on unordered list and how that children elements can "inhert" parent border radius with overflow: hidden.
